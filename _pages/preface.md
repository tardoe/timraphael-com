I have set myself a goal of writing more - mostly about the things i'm interested in, proofs-of-concept I develop, architectures and designs I concoct and literally anything else. I don't expect the technical content of this blog to be 100% accurate all the time, though I will make every effort to make it so, this will be a process of learning. I want this to be a place for feedback and insight as I attempt to solidfy my own opinions into more mature thoughts and ideas.

I will always welcome feedback, thoughts, ideas and corrections to [me@timraphael.com](mailto:me@timraphael.com)
