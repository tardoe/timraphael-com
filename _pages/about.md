I currently work for [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), an IaaS cloud provider working as a Senior Network Engineer within the Edge and Backbone team. I have previously worked for the [Internet Association of Australia](https://internet.asn.au) as a Senior Peering Engineer working to grow the [IX Australia](https://ix.asn.au) peering fabric and encourage more networks to peer in Australia. Before that I held roles with smaller cloud providers and managed service providers as I honed my skills as a network engineer.

Through my journey I have tried to shared my experience with others,  whenever I was given the opportunity. Below you'll find a record of past conference talks, podcast appearances and syndicated blog posts hosted on other platforms.
